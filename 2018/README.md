Test sets available filling in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/s9gT6I5Xaa61yK993); an email notification will be sent with the links to the files.  
As the training sets have been removed from the public repository at this stage, this will allow you to get the training data as well.




For more information on the task, see also the guidelines available in this repository, and the [web page](http://www.di.unito.it/~tutreeb/haspeede-evalita18/index.html).
